# WPC
Weighted Prioritized Combinator

WPC is a tool for maintaining a set of test options of varying importance. It includes a simple language (`wpc`), a compiler (which turns `.wpc` files into test parameter instances), and an executor (which generates test parameters based on a parameter instance).

WPC is written to be used in a testing environment where there are so many combinations that testing everything every time is unfeasible. Due to the stateful nature of parameter instances, tests can be "resumed" between code updates, and combinations of parameters are tested in an order that optimizes the variety of combinations; test maximum amount of stuff in minimum amount of time!

Quick example:
```
# file: cow.wpc
cow {
  normal value green;
  uninteresting value white;
}
```
Compile:
```Bash
$ wpc cow.wpc
2
```
(Let's ignore the interest stuff for now.) We get a 2 back. That tells us the number of combinations there are in total. In our case, there are two combinations:

* `cow=green`
* `cow=white`

The call to `wpc` generated a `cow.scd` file. This is an *instance* of the cow test above; we can derive parameters for testing from this using the `wpx` command:
```Bash
$ wpx cow.scd
cow=green
$ wpx cow.scd
cow=white
$ wpx cow.scd
$ 
```

Let's briefly talk about the interest part now. First let's try this again with the values flipped:
```
# file: cow2.wpc
cow2 {
  uninteresting value white;
  normal value green;
}
```
If we run this one we get:
```Bash
$ wpx cow2.scd
cow2=green
$ wpx cow2.scd
cow2=white
$ wpx cow2.scd
$ 
```
I.e. the exact same output as above. While there is some randomness (called "blurring" here), parameters are in fact ordered in a fixed manner.

There are currently 6 prioritizers for values: heavy (-1), uninteresting (-1), normal (0), light (+1), interesting (+1), prioritized (+1). These can be combined any number of times, e.g.
```
heavy uninteresting prioritized value x;
```
(would produce a value `x` for the given option, whose priority is `-1-1+1=-1`).

The priority of a value determines the order in which the value is enabled. You can list the contents of an instance, and see priorities for each configuration, by prepending the `wpx` call with `-l` or `--list`.
```Bash
$ wpc cow.wcd
2
$ wpx -l cow.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  1 | -0.01590 |  0.00000 | cow=white
  0 |  1.02936 |  0.00000 | cow=green
$ wpc cow2.wpc
2
$ wpx -l cow2.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  1 |  0.02938 |  0.00000 | cow2=white
  0 |  1.02610 |  0.00000 | cow2=green
$ 
```
(the outputs differ, not because `cow.wcd` is different from `cow2.wcd`, but because the starting priorities are blurred; try compiling and listing multiple times and you'll note that each time is slightly different)

## Configuration priority

When emitting the next configuration to test, WPC makes use of priorities to judge which parameters have been tested the least, or which configuration is *the most interesting* at this point in time.

This is achieved by doing two things:
* firstly, by generating a configuration priority for all possible combinations based on the priorities of their individual selections
* secondly, by modifying the configuration priority for all remaining combinations, so that combinations whose selections have been tested are decreased

The formula for modifying a configuration is as follows:
* for each option where the configuration setting is equal to the emitted configuration option,
* let penalty = (.01 + .02 * (i / o)) * (1 - .05p), where
* i = number of emissions where the option used the setting,
* o = total number of times the setting is used across all configurations,
* p = priority value

The new priority for the configuration is the old one minus the sum of all penalties for all options.

To see how this works we need to expand our cow test to include a ferret:
```
# file: animals.wpc
cow {
  normal value green;
  uninteresting value white;
}
ferret {
  normal value squirrely;
  normal value slithery;
}
```
Compile:
```Bash
$ wpc animals.wpc
4
$ wpx -l animals.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  3 | -0.01729 |  0.00000 | cow=white, ferret=slithery
  2 | -0.00625 |  0.00000 | cow=white, ferret=squirrely
  1 |  0.97984 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=slithery
  0 |  1.04784 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=squirrely
$
```
We now have four combinations: green cow and squirrely ferret, green cow and slithery ferret, white cow and slithery ferret, and white cow and squirrely ferret.

If we emit a configuration WPC will note that we have now tested green cows once, and will subsequently lower the priority of *all green cow configurations*. It will similarly lower the priority for all squirrely ferret configurations, since we will have tested that once, as well:
```Bash
$ wpx animals.scd
cow=green
ferret=squirrely
$ wpx -l animals.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  2 | -0.02625 |  0.02000 | cow=white, ferret=squirrely
  1 | -0.01729 |  0.00000 | cow=white, ferret=slithery
  0 |  0.95984 |  0.02000 | cow=green, ferret=slithery
$
```
You may notice that the order has changed; WPC has now penalized the white cow/squirrely ferret case, because we've already tested squirrely ferrets once (see the "PEN" column above). If we emit another instance:
```Bash
$ wpx animals.scd
cow=green
ferret=slithery
$ wpx -l animals.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  1 | -0.03729 |  0.02000 | cow=white, ferret=slithery
  0 | -0.02625 |  0.00000 | cow=white, ferret=squirrely
```
the order has flipped back again, because this time, we penalized ferret=slithery. This may seem pointless, but with more complex cases (and more options), this works out in favor of testing combinations efficiently. The `-s` flag can be used to show statistics on how tested each individual setting has been so far:
```Bash
$ wpx -s animals.scd
 cow          ferret
 green white  squirrely slithery
 100   0      50        50         (%)
 0     -1     0         0          (priority)
 2     0      1         1          (count)
 2     2      2         2          (total)
$
```
We note that green cows have 100% tested, while squirrely and slithery ferrets lie at 50% each. If we had kept all of the settings at the same priority (i.e. if we changed cow=white to normal), this would have come out something like this (due to blurring factor, this is not always the case):
```Bash
 cow          ferret
 green white  squirrely slithery
 50    50     50        50         (%)
 0     0      0         0          (priority)
 1     1      1         1          (count)
 2     2      2         2          (total)
```

Note: the `wpx` command will return an exit code `0` if a configuration was emitted successfully, and an exit code `1` if there were no configurations left to test.

## Simple bash script example

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test cows and ferrets
# If user writes "resume" as first argument, we resume from the existing file otherwise
# we restart
if [ "$1" != "resume" ]; then
    echo "Generating schedule"
    wpc animals.wpc
fi
while true; do
    wpx -l animals.scd
    wpx animals.scd > instance.rc
    ec=$?
    if [ $ec -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Finished all instances"
        break
    elif [ $ec -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "wpx call failed!"
        exit 1
    fi
    source instance.rc
    echo "TESTING cow value: $cow   ferret value: $ferret"
    for i in $(seq 3); do sleep 1; echo -n -e ". "; done
    echo " OK"
done
```
Run example:
```Bash
$ ./simple.sh

## Conditions

> Slithery ferrets need green cows.

WPC includes a simple condition operator for values.

Let's say we have a system which may or may not use a database backend (`db=mysql`, `db=none`).
We have a series of database related properties, such as `db_location=remote`, `db_location=local`,
which are only relevant if we actually *have* a database in the first place.
WPC can be told that a specific value depends on some other value in some manner:
```
# file: animals.wpc
cow {
  normal value green;
  uninteresting value white;
}
ferret {
  normal value squirrely;
  normal value slithery(cow==green);
}
```
When we compile this:
```
$ wpc animals.wpc
3
```
we only get 3 alternatives, not 4:
```
$ wpx -l animals.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  2 |  0.01527 |  0.00000 | cow=white, ferret=squirrely
  1 |  1.00490 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=slithery
  0 |  1.04808 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=squirrely
$ 
```
To take the example above:
```
# file: websrv.wpc
db {
  uninteresting value none;
  normal value mysql;
}
db_location {
  normal value remote(db!=none);
  normal value local(db!=none);
  normal value none(db==none);
}
```
```Bash
$ wpc websrv.wpc
3
$ wpx -l websrv.scd
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  2 |  0.04812 |  0.00000 | db=none, db_location=none
  1 |  0.96662 |  0.00000 | db=mysql, db_location=local
  0 |  1.02313 |  0.00000 | db=mysql, db_location=remote
$ 
```

Note: you may end up with skipped options due to conditions. This:
```
# file: animals.wpc
cow {
  normal value green;
  uninteresting value white;
}
ferret {
  normal value squirrely(cow==green);
  normal value slithery(cow==green);
}
```
will result in something like this:
```Bash
 #  |    PRI   |    PEN   | CONFIG
  1 | -0.00603 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=slithery
  0 |  0.04816 |  0.00000 | cow=green, ferret=squirrely
```
I.e. no white cow tests will ever be scheduled!

## Extra output

By default, WPC will only output `option=value` for each option. Sometimes you want to include additional output based on selected values, such as database hosts or such:

```
# file: websrv.wpc
db {
  uninteresting value none;
  normal value mysql;
}
db_location {
  normal value remote(db!=none) {{
    db_host=remote-server.somewhere
  }}
  normal value local(db!=none) {{
    db_host=localhost
  }}
  normal value none(db==none);
}
```
```Bash
$ wpc websrv.wpc
3
$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mysql
db_location=local
    db_host=localhost

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mysql
db_location=remote
    db_host=remote-server.somewhere

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=none
db_location=none
$ 
```

Anything between the double curlies will be emitted as is, and may include code snippets or such (the only restriction is that it must not contain "`}}`", as that will end the sequence):

```
# file: websrv.wpc
db {
  uninteresting value none;
  normal value mysql;
  normal value mongodb;
}
db_location {
  normal value remote(db!=none) {{
    if [ "$db" = "mongodb" ]; then
        db_host=remote-mongo-server.somewhere
    else
        db_host=remote-server.somewhere
    fi
  }}
  normal value local(db!=none) {{
    db_host=localhost
  }}
  normal value none(db==none);
}
```
```Bash
$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mongodb
db_location=local
    db_host=localhost

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mongodb
db_location=remote
    if [ "$db" = "mongodb" ]; then
        db_host=remote-mongo-server.somewhere
    else
        db_host=remote-server.somewhere
    fi

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mysql
db_location=remote
    if [ "$db" = "mongodb" ]; then
        db_host=remote-mongo-server.somewhere
    else
        db_host=remote-server.somewhere
    fi

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=mysql
db_location=local
    db_host=localhost

$ wpx websrv.scd
db=none
db_location=none
$ 
```
